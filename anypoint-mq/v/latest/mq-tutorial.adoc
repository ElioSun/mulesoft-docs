= Tutorial: To Use Anypoint MQ
:keywords: mq, tutorial, queue, exchange, message exchange, client, studio, postman

This guide helps you send and receive messages using Anypoint MQ using a publish/subscribe
queue mechanism. Anypoint MQ provides a user interface built into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] that
lets you send messages to a queue or message exchange, and then read the messages from a queue. Anypoint MQ also provides a connector that works with Anypoint Studio. This tutorial explains how to use these features.

This tutorial helps you
create a queue and send and receive messages, create a client ID and secret for an application, and use the Anypoint MQ connector in Anypoint Studio to send and receive messages to the application. The advanced section helps you create a message exchange to send a message to multiple queues.

== Prerequisites

. Read link:/anypoint-mq/mq-understanding[Understanding Anypoint MQ] to familiarize yourself with the terminology and concepts of using MQ.
. Create an link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] account to configure user permissions, register applications in MQ, and to create queues and message exchanges. You can access Anypoint MQ from the main link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] screen and the left navigation bar. You can also open or close the left navigation bar by pressing the Escape key on your keyboard, or by clicking the menu icon at the upper left of the screen.
. link:https://www.mulesoft.com/support-and-services/mule-esb-support-license-subscription[Subscribe]Â to Mule Enterprise - An Enterprise license is required to use the MQ server software.
. Install link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Anypoint Studio].

IMPORTANT: If you or another person in your organization has not created an environment, user access, and roles for accessing Anypoint MQ, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-access-management[Anypoint MQ Access Management] before starting this tutorial.

== Anypoint MQ Queues

A queue provides a temporary area for holding messages. Applications
push messages to the queue and other applications consume
the messages. In Anypoint MQ, you can read messages, return the messages
for later viewing, or delete a message. By default, messages return to the
waiting area so other applications can read them. Messages persist until the
time to live (TTL) value expires--by default, a message persists in Anypoint MQ
for 7 days.

Queue and message exchange names can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), dots (.), and dashes (-). All other characters are not allowed. Queue and message exchange names are limited to 127 characters in length.

=== Create a Queue

To create a queue:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click *MQ* from the initial Anypoint Platform screen or from the left navigation bar.
+
image:mq-ap-access.png[mq-ap-access]
+
. Click *Destinations*:
+
image:mq-destinations-option.png[mq-destinations-option]
+
. Click the blue plus icon image:mq-blue-plus-icon.png[mq-blue-plus-icon].
. In the drop-down, click *Queue*:
+
image:mq-create-q-screen-dlq.png[mq-create-q-screen-dlq]
+
. In the Create Queue screen, specify a name for the queue, and if needed, change the
Default TTL (time-to-live) and Default Lock TTL values. A message lock makes a message unavailable to other applications while locked. A locked message does not block other messages to be read.
. If you want your queue encrypted,
slide the encryption slider to the right.
. If your organization previously created a dead letter queue where undeliverable messages go, click *Assign a Dead Letter Queue* to enable this option. For more information on dead letter queues, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-queues#create-a-queue[To Create a Queue].
. When done, click *Save Changes*:
+
The queue creates and you are returned to the *Destinations* screen.
+
*Note*: Where you click on a queue entry in the Destinations screen governs
what you see next:
+
image:mq-entryui.png[mq-entryui]

NOTE: If you need to delete a queue, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-faq#how-do-i-delete-a-queue[How do I delete a queue?] in the link:/anypoint-mq/mq-faq[Anypoint MQ FAQ].

=== Send a Message to a Queue

To send a message to a queue:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the drop-down left navigation bar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the MyDemoQueue entry in Destinations to view details about
the queue.
. Click the left side of the queue entry to open the Messaging feature, or click the right side of the queue entry and click the arrow to the right of the queue name:
+
image:mq-access-messaging2.png[mq-access-messaging2]
+
. In the settings page, click *Message Sender*:
+
image:mq-click-msg-sender2.png[mq-click-msg-sender2]
+
. Type text in the *Payload* such as `Hello Mules` (leave the *Type* field set to *Text*):
+
image:mq-msg-sender-text-payload2.png[mq-msg-sender-text-payload2]
+
. Click *Send*.

=== Verify the Message in a Queue

To verify that the message arrived in the queue:

. Click *Destinations*:
+
image:mq-destinations-option.png[mq-destinations-option]
+
. Click the right side of the queue entry to view details and see the number of messages in the queue:
+
image:mq-num-queued-msgs.png[mq-num-queued-msgs]

=== Get a Message From a Queue

To get a message from a queue:

. Follow the directions in <<Send a Message to a Queue>> and
advance to Step 6, except click *Message Browser*:
+
image:mq-click-msg-browser2.png[mq-click-msg-browser2]
+
. Click *Get Messages*.
+
image:mq-get-messages2.png[mq-get-messages2]
+
. Click the message ID value to view the message.
+
image:mq-click-id2.png[mq-click-id2]
+
. If you want to return the message to the queue, such as if other applications may also want to read
the message, click the *Return Messages* icon - this is the default condition. If you switch screens back
to the Message Sender or to Destinations, messages automatically return to the queue.
In Anypoint MQ, returning the messages to the queue is known as `nack` - the message is not altered. However,
the time to live (TTL) value you set when you created your queue determines how long the message is available
before Anypoint MQ deletes it.
+
image:mq-click-retmsgs2.png[mq-click-retmsgs2]
+
Alternatively, you can delete the message by clicking the trash can icon. Anypoint MQ provides three modes for how messages delete after they are viewed. For more information, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-ack-mode[Anypoint MQ Acknowledgement Mode].
+
image:mq-message-delete-trash-can-icon2.png[mq-message-delete-trash-can-icon2]

Now you are able to send and receive messages in Anypoint MQ. In the next section, you can try
alternate ways of formatting messages.

=== Send a CSV or JSON Message

To send a JSON message:

. Click *Message Sender*.
. Set the *Type* to *JSON*.
. Set the *Payload* to:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
"animal that walks":"dog",
"animal that swims":"fish",
"animal that flies":"parrot"
}
----
+
. Click *Message Browser* and the message ID to view the message:

== Configure Anypoint Studio for MQ

In this section, we use link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Anypoint Studio] to create a simple application that you can use
to publish a message to a queue, or to consume the message, and to ack and nack the message.

In the next section, we return to link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] and register an application that we can use in Studio.

[NOTE]
====
The Studio screens that follow use the new Anypoint Studio Light Theme appearance option which is the default style for Studio 6 and newer. You can set this theme in older versions of Studio by clicking *Anypoint Studio* > *Preferences* > *General* > *Appearance* > *Theme* > *Studio Light Theme (Beta)*.

== Test Your Application

Get a REST plugin for your browser so that you can send POST requests. Typical software:

* link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop[Postman for Chrome]
* link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-rest-client/fhjcajmcbmldlhcimfajhfbgofnpcjmb[Simple REST Client for Chrome].
* link:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/restclient[RESTClient for Firefox].
* link:http://www.telerik.com/fiddler[Fiddler for Windows].

The following is an example setup using Postman:

image:mq-post.png[mq-post]

To set up Postman for a REST POST:

. Specify the URL to send the message as `0.0.0.0:8081/mq/Hello`. You can also specify messages with spaces such as,
`0.0.0.0:8081/mq/My What A Great Message`.
. Click *POST* in the drop-down options menu.
. Click *Send* to post the message. You can send more than one message if you prefer.
. View the resulting reply from the Anypoint Studio web server.

=== Viewing Your Message in Anypoint MQ

To view your message:

. Switch back to link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform], and if needed, log in, and click *MQ* in the left navigation bar.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click `MyDemoQueue` at the right side to view the number of messages in the queue:
+
image:mq-messages-in-queue2.png[mq-messages-in-queue2]
+
You can see the number of messages in the queue. Having verified that you have messages, we can now view them.
+
. Click `MyDemoQueue` at the start of the entry to view the Queue Settings, Message Sender, and Message Browser.
+
image:mq-view-mydemoq-settings2.png[mq-view-mydemoq-settings2]
+
. Click *Message Browser* and click *Get Messages*:
+
image:mq-get-messages2.png[mq-get-messages2]
+
. Click a message ID and view the message to the right.
+
image:mq-click-id-to-see-msg2.png[mq-click-id-to-see-msg2]

You can repeat this process by returning to your REST POST application and sending and viewing more messages.
In the next section, we build on your knowledge, first with an administrative task of creating user roles and then creating and testing message exchanges, which let you send one message to multiple queues.

[[advancedmq]]
=== Message Exchanges

The sections that follow help you work with message exchanges. A message exchange
consists of a collection of one or more queues. Message exchanges help you organize
queues and send one message to all its bound queues. You can still send and
receive messages from a bound queue, but the message exchange ensures all queues
get the same message.

Message exchange and queue names can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), dots (.), and dashes (-). All other characters are not allowed. Message exchange and queue names are limited to 127 characters in length.

==== Create a Message Exchange

To create a message exchange:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click the menu icon at the top left of the screen and click *MQ* from the left navigation bar, or click *MQ* from the Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the blue plus circle.
. Click *Exchange*.
+
image:mq-create-demo-exchange.png[mq-create-demo-exchange, width="325"]
+
. Specify the name `MyDemoExchange`.
. Click the checkbox to bind MyDemoQueue to this message exchange.
. Click *Save Changes*.
. In the Destinations screen. click the message exchange *Type* to list its details.

NOTE: If you need to delete a message exchange, see link:/anypoint-mq/mq-faq#how-do-i-delete-an-exchange[How do I delete a Message Exchange?] in the link:/anypoint-mq/mq-faq[Anypoint MQ FAQ].

==== Bind a Queue to a Message Exchange

To bind a queue to a message exchange:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the left side of the message exchange entry in Destinations.
+
*Note*: Where you click on a message exchange entry in the Destinations table governs
what you see next:
+
image:mq-where-to-click-x2.png[mq-where-to-click-x2]
+
. In the Exchange menu, click *Bind* for each queue you want to bind to the message exchange:
+
image:mq-bind-queue-to-exchange2.png[mq-bind-queue-to-exchange2]

==== Send a Message to a Message Exchange

Sending a message to a message exchange is very similar to sending a message to a queue.
The only difference is that you can get the message from any queue bound to a message exchange.

To send a message to a message exchange:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the `MessageExchange` entry in Destinations to view details about
the message exchange.
. Click the *MessageExchange* link in the details screen to access the Message Sender:
+
image:mq-exchange-msg-access2.png[mq-exchange-msg-access2]
+
. Click *Message Sender*:
+
image:mq-exchange-msg-sender2.png[mq-exchange-msg-sender2]
+
. Type the contents of the *Payload* and click *Send*:
+
image:mq-exchange-payload2.png[mq-exchange-payload2]

You can now use the Message Browser to get the message from the MyDemoQueue as described
in <<Get a Message From a Queue>>.

You can also send comma-separated value (CSV) or JSON content in the payload by changing
the message *Type* value. For more information, see <<Send a CSV or JSON Message>>.
