:keywords: mq, access, roles, environment, anypoint platform

Anypoint Platform lets you manage the link:/access-management/managing-permissions[roles] of those who administer the MQ features in Anypoint Platform for your organization.

== Create an Environment

Before you can give yourself MQ access permissions, you need an environment to associate permissions with.

To create an environment:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click *Access Management* from the left navigation bar or click *Access Management* from the main Anypoint Platform screen:

+
. In the Add Environment screen, provide a name for your environment, and click either Production or Sandbox. You may want to create separate environments for each. A sandbox is used to test applications, whereas production is the public view. For this tutorial, you can choose *Production*.

== Give Users MQ Access Permissions

First give yourself MQ access permissions and then give others in your organization access.

=== Assign User Permissions

Assign user permissions to yourself for use with MQ. These permissions let you create client applications, and destinations by creating queues and exchanges. You can use this same information to assign user permissions for others in your organization.

To assign user permissions:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. From the left navigation bar or the main screen, click *Access Management*:
+

+
TIP: You can press the Escape key on your keyboard to open or close the left navigation bar in Anypoint Platform.
+
. Click *Users*.
+
. Click your username value:
+

+
. Click *MQ* and set an environment and permissions. For permissions, you can click *Select all* to set all permissions, or *Select none* to erase previously clicked settings:

+
A summary list appears:
+

+
You can use this display to delete permissions if needed.

== Create MQ Roles

You can create a role that you can apply to other users in your organization.
While you don't need roles to complete this tutorial, when you use MQ as an administrator or developer, you should create
roles for all those in your organization who use MQ.

Creating a role lets you assign access rights to users in your organization, such as for administrators, developers, or for those who only view information but don't change it.

=== Create an Admin Role

To assign role permissions:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. Click *Access Management* in the left navigation bar available from the menu icon in the upper left of the task bar, or by clicking in the main Anypoint Platform screen:
+
image:mq-access-mgmt-access.png[mq-access-mgmt-access]
+
. Click Roles and *Add role*.
+
image:mq-roles-add-role.png[mq-roles-add-role.png]
+
. Name the role `Admin Role` and click the *Add role* button.
. Click the Role name and click *MQ*.
. Specify the *Production* Environment, and set all the Permissions by clicking *Select All*:

+
. Click the blue plus button to save your changes. Anypoint Platform displays your settings.

=== Add Additional Roles For MQ Access

After you create an admin role, you can optionally create other roles for users in your organization who need Anypoint MQ access in Anypoint Platform.

. From the left navigation bar or the main screen, click *Access Management*.
. Click *Roles* and *Add role*:
+

+

+
. In the list of roles, click the name of role you just created:
+
image:mq-roles-list.png[mq-roles-list]
+
. Click *MQ* and set an environment and permissions. For permissions, you can click *Select all* to set all permissions, or *Select none* to erase previously clicked settings:
+

+
. Click the blue plus icon to save your settings:
+
image:mq-blue-plus-circle.png[mq-blue-plus-circle]
+
A summary list appears:
+
image:mq-perms-display.png[mq-perms-display]
+
You can use this display to delete permissions if needed, or you can delete the role.
+
You can also delete a role from the Roles list page by clicking the checkbox for an entry, and then clicking *Delete role*.
