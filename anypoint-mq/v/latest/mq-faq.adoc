= FAQ: About Anypoint MQ
:keywords: mq, faq, questions, answers

This document lists frequently asked questions about link:/anypoint-mq[Anypoint MQ].

== FAQ: Why is MQ not shown in Anypoint Platform?

Anypoint MQ requires a separate Enterprise subscription and is not included in the Anypoint Platform trial version. Contact your mailto:support@mulesoft.com[MuleSoft representative] for more information. If you don't have an Enterprise subscription,
you can use MuleSoft's link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/amqp-connector[Active MQ] or link:https://www.rabbitmq.com/[Rabbit MQ].

== FAQ: How do I create and send messages into MQ from Mule?

After you obtain an Enterprise subscription and contacted your MuleSoft representative to activate Anypoint MQ, you can use link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] to create a queue or message exchange, and send messages to it. For more information, see the link:/anypoint-mq/mq-tutorial[MQ Tutorial].

== FAQ: How does MQ encrypt messages?

If you choose to link:/anypoint-mq/mq-queues#create-a-queue[encrypt messages], Anypoint MQ provides 
password-based encryption using PBE with MD5 and Triple DES, and with a 168-bit key.

== FAQ: Why can't I see FIFO Queue in the plus button?

If the blue create button doesn't list *FIFO Queue*:

* Ensure you have an Anypoint MQ FIFO entitlement. Check with your MuleSoft representative.
* Ensure that your region setting is US-West:

== FAQ: How many in flight messages can I have per queue?

Anypoint MQ supports up to 120,000 in flight messages per each non-FIFO queue. FIFO queues permit up to 20,000 in 
flight messages per FIFO queue due to the extra processing required for FIFO queues. 
An in flight message is a message received 
by a queue, but not deleted, that is, a message awaiting ACK or NACK, or a message with an expired 
*Default Lock TTL* (time-to-live) setting. A single queue can contain an unlimited number of
messages; however the number of in flight messages is limited. The maximum duration for any message, either in
flight or not is 2 weeks, after which Anypoint MQ deletes the message.

== FAQ: Can I use Anypoint MQ on premises?

You can publish a message from an on-premises system to Anypoint MQ and have another on-premises subscriber pull messages off of Anypoint MQ.
Currently Anypoint MQ cannot be deployed on-premises. If you need a messaging source on-premises, you can use MuleSoft's  link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/amqp-connector[Active MQ] instead.

== FAQ: How can non-Mule applications interface with Anypoint MQ?

If you have non-Mule applications, you can use our link:/anypoint-mq/mq-apis[MQ REST API] to send and receive messages.

== FAQ: What is the throughput capacity of Anypoint MQ?

Anypoint MQ is horizontally scalable and we can support higher throughputs as needed.

== FAQ: Can I be notified when a message arrives in a queue?

Anypoint MQ provides long polling. You can do a REST request and ask the server
to keep the TCP socket open for up to 20 seconds to fulfill your request if there are not enough messages.

== FAQ: How can I process messages one by one?

To process messages one by one, set the Anypoint MQ connector to the consume operation, which retrieves a
message from the queue, or receives null if a message is not available. In addition, use a synchronous flow 
with a poll scope to fire the process regularly. More than one in-flight message can occur if the process 
time between `anypoint-mq:consume` and `anypoint-mq:ack` is not lower than the *Default Lock TTL* for the queue, 
and if you don't create exception options and NACK the message accordingly.

Example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="testanypointmq1by1Flow2" processingstrategy="synchronous">
    <poll doc:name="Poll">
        <logger doc:name="Logger" level="INFO" message="Pooling fired"></logger>
    </poll>
    <anypoint-mq:consume config-ref="Anypoint_MQ_Configuration" destination="queuename" doc:name="Anypoint MQ"/>
    <logger doc:name="Logger" level="INFO" message="Processing message received. #[payload]"/>
    <anypoint-mq:ack config-ref="Anypoint_MQ_Configuration" doc:name="Anypoint MQ"/>
    <logger doc:name="Logger" level="INFO" message="Message processed."/>
</flow>

== FAQ: Add MQ connector support to Mule shared resources?

The only officially supported connectors and transports for shared resources are: HTTP/HTTPS, VM, JMS, JMS Caching Connection Factory, Database, WMQ, JBoss Transaction Manager, and Bitronix Transaction Manager.

== FAQ: If a data center fails, what happens to in-flight messages?

There are multiple data centers in a region which again have multiple availability zones. One availability zone going down does not affect Anypoint MQ services. If the whole region goes down, only a service in that region can be affected.

See also: <<How many in flight messages can I have per queue?>>

== FAQ: If an availability zone fails, what's the client impact?

Anypoint MQ provides persistent data storage across multiple data centers in a region, ensuring that it can handle data center outages and provide full disaster recovery in case of an availability zone going down.

== FAQ: Can I use a retry strategy with the MQ connector?

The Anypoint MQ connector does not exactly use a connection-based protocol,
but uses REST behind the scenes, and therefore,
you cannot use reconnection strategies with this connector.

On the inbound side, you can easily mimic a retry strategy using a max redelivery attribute set to your maximum number of retries and an exception strategy to move to a DLQ when the limit is hit.

On the outbound side, stick to the same triggering mechanism.
Otherwise you can use the *until-successful* element with this connector.

You should also configure the HTTP connector so that Global Element Properties > *Set Max Redelivery* is set to the `-1` value.

== FAQ: How do we recover and handle failover?

The network that Anypoint MQ runs on provides high availability replications across its many datacenters.

== FAQ: How do we ensure a message is uniquely processed when failover occurs?

If a server fails and failover occurs, messages continue to be processed on other servers in the network on which Anypoint MQ runs. Normal Anypoint MQ queues do not guarantee only-once message delivery, only FIFO queues support only-once message delivery. The high availability network deduplicates messages for FIFO queues automatically.

== FAQ: Does MQ guarantee message delivery?

Yes, Anypoint MQ guarantees "at least once" delivery of messages to the destination.

== FAQ: How do I create lots of queues and message exchanges?

You can use a `curl` command with the link:/anypoint-mq/mq-apis#mqadminapi[REST Administration API] in a `for` loop to create the number of queues and message exchanges you need. See an link:/anypoint-mq/mq-apis#excoliuscu[example `curl` command] that you can alter to create a queue or message exchange.

== FAQ: How do I delete a queue?

To delete a queue:

. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the *right* side of the queue entry in the Destinations table:
+
image:mq-click-type-q2.png[mq-click-type-q2]
+
. Click the trash can symbol in the upper right.
. In the Delete Queue menu, click the checkbox:
+
image:mq-delete-queue.png[mq-delete-queue]
+
. Click *Delete Queue*.

*Note*: The time it takes to delete or purge a queue is approximately one minute. During this time, the status of the affected queue may not be updated.

== FAQ: How do I delete a message exchange?

To delete a message exchange:

. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the *right* side of the message exchange entry in the Destinations table:
+

+
. Click the trash can symbol in the upper right.
. In the Delete Exchange menu, click the checkbox:
